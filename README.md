- 👋 Hi, I’m @dertyp123
- 👀 I’m interested in :  Semiconductor physics for III/V  devices processing. 
                          I'm trying to use Python as Interface/Framework to simulate and fit optical as well elctrical properties 
                          
- 🌱 I’m currently learning : -Python for 4years, 
                              -speedup calculations with numba, 
                              -speedup the detection and fitting of peaks in 2D and 3D data
                              -arrange my code libary to modules
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on : easy and ready to use packages for abouve mentioned
